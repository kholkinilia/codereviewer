    "The objective of this notebook is to look at predictions of the CodeReviewer model before and after fine-tuning for the Review generation task. The original paper of CodeReviewer can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09095).\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to look at the performance of the model on Kotlin programming language. It's interesting to look at, since Kotlin code was not present in the dataset. However, the model \"saw\" Java, which looks somewhat like Kotlin (maybe the with the help of beer). So, let's see if it's going to generalize to Kotlin or not. Of course, we don't expect it to generate something like \"rewrite it in Kotlin style\" before fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Kotlin repo to take?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take the [Kotlin Programming Language](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) repo! It has plenty of PRs. Therefore, finding comments shouldn't be an issue. Although the Kotlin repo has its specifics. For example, comments like `\"Filed https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-44513\"`, which are impossible to predict without external knowledge. Nevertheless, I think all repos have their own specifics. So, it's a fine repo to look at.\n"

From the paper, it seems that we only need to provide diffs to the model.
